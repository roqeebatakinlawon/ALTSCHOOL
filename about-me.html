      <p> I am AKINLAWON ROQEEBAT  born on 25 August  at Abeokuta, in western
      Nigeria.</p>
      
     <p> After preparatory and basic primary education in 2009, I continued at
      Abeokuta Grammar School, where later in 2019 I took my Secondary School
      Leaving Certificate (SSCE).</p>
      <p>
        During the six years spent in the school, I used to be  a known member of the
        Literary and Debating society where I represented my school at
        various speech, oratory contest including the famous “Wole Soyinka Essay
        Competition” and Park INN by Radisson schools debate. I was however
        presented with an award of recognition due to my remarkable and
        outstanding performance at the Presidential Schools Debate (2015).

          I am currently enrolled as a second year student at the Ogun State
          College of Nursing Sciences where I specializes in Midwifery. Like many
          adult students,  I am required to arrange and meet specific criteria
          so as to  qualify and pursue my chosen healthcare career.

          As an ambitious young girl that is always eager to lean a new skill,
          before my admission into the Nursing school in 2022, I got herself
          into a fashion school where she learnt the basics of styling and
          fashion designing. Even while at school, I take my leisure time to
          design clothes for my colleagues where I earns a little amount of
          money to support my education.
        </li>
